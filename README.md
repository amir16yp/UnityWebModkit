This is a fork of UnityWebModkit to support more modern Unity versions, as well as to fix some bugs. It isn't really ready to be used, has a ton of code that exists solely for debugging purposes, is very buggy, etc etc.

If you make any changes to fix a bug or support a new game, please send a PR!

I'll be maintaining this, but I won't be adding any significant new features since I'm working on a better modding solution (more akin to il2cppinterop, or modding desktop games with c++).
